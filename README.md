## A Study on Coordinate Extraction and Ball Stroke Posture Analysis Using 6-Axis Gyro Sensor

In this study, we designed a system to allow first time users of billiards to practice correct stroke position alone. 
Using a six-axis gyro sensor, acceleration, gyro, and geomagnetic values are collected by Android-to-gyro sensor BLE communication.
The velocity, angle, and direction of the stroke are calculated to show the similarity rate. In addition, the mobile is vibrated to give a feeling of impact when stroking.
Using the touched value of the sensor, the user can actually see the target point of the hit in real time on the mobile. At the same time, the previously calculated similarity rate can be confirmed by a graph and a numerical value. It helps you learn the correct stroke posture through feedback compared to the best posture.

This source code can be compiled with Android Studio and Gradle.
